## Finding the IP of the Target Machine

The IP of the target machine is found by using [Netdiscover tool](https://github.com/alexxy/netdiscover).

Here the IP of the vulnerable machine is **192.168.1.230**
## Initial Scan 

First, [Nmap scanner](https://github.com/nmap/nmap) is used to find all the open ports and services running. 
And here we find that Apache 1.3.20 is running
on port 80

It's time to do some more recon. 

We use [Nikto Web scanner](https://github.com/sullo/nikto) to find all those server side vulnerabilities and it shows some details about the Apache 1.3.2 vulnerabilities

## Exploit

When we search about Apache/1.3.20 and mod_ssl/2.8.4 we can see that there is an exploit for â€˜OpenLuckV2.c' Remote Buffer Overflow. So we download the [Exploit](https://github.com/heltonWernik/OpenLuck).
<br>
And then we run it.
After running the exploit we will get root access in the Target machine <3
